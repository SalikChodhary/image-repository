# Shopify Challenge Backend & SRE Summer 2021 Challenge

This is my submission for the Shopify Challenge: [ec2-18-191-146-168.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com](ec2-18-191-146-168.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com). The goal of the challenge was to build a image repository, I chose to build a REST API with the following features:
#### Search for image(s)
  * By Text; in the form of tags
  * By ID; ID is automatically generated for every image that is added to the repo
  * By User; returns all public images of a given user
  * Default search; returns all public image
  
#### Add an image
  * I started by using **GridFS**, to store images and metadata, in **MongoDB**, but I did not like this implementation, as I wanted a remote URI so users can access images without being forced to download them. So, I used the same idea and split up the metadata and the actual image. All image metadata is stored in a **MongoDB** database. This metadata contains a key, that points to an **AWS S3 Bucket Link** that holds the actual image.
  * Users can tag images
  * **Computer Vision** is implemented to auto-tag all images, by making use of **Google's Vision API**
  * **Access Control** - Users can specify if any image is public/private
  
 #### Secure 
  * Users must create an account
  * Users are given a **JWT token** if they can **login**, that expires every **1 hour**
  * They must pass the given JWT Token with every request, to gain access to the data
  * User and passwords(**after hashing and salting**) are stored in MongoDB
  
 #### Deployment 
  * Deployed in a **Linux AWS EC2** instance
  * Build script lives in remote server, contains sensitive information, that is only exposed as environment variables at build time

## Technologies/Tools Used
* Golang (w/ mux for routing)
* AWS (EC2 & S3)
* MongoDB
* Google Vision API
* JWT Tokens
